The Plot Review 1

In this assignment I am reviewing the plot submitted by Yunhe Cui below:

The plot represents the population of NYC by ZIP code. I will start with commenting on technical aspects of the plot. First of all, it is labeled correstly and has a title on top and description at the bottom. Thanks to that I have no confusion regarding what the author wants to present and what is the general goal. Scale is described numerically both on the color map and the map positioning itself. one thing that could be added but not neccessarily, is the label to the x,y, and color scales. However, in general it appears to me self-explanatory. 

From clarity point of view, it is clear to me what the author means and quantities are clear. Population size is well-presented per zip code in different shades so the main point is well understandable. However, I believe that for some magnitudes the chosen color scale is not effective - the regions with low population are barely visible on the graph. Same comes to the most populated ones that are neighbouring with other highly populated areas - yone can barely distinguish between zip areas in such case. 

Building on the point above, grey scale not only raises some confusion in reading the values and seeing the areas, but also is not the most aesthetically pleasing choice. While it is minimalistic, other color schemes would be easier to copmrehend since the whole plot is on white background. The contrast build using other color (like orange or blue) could be helpful.

From honesty point of view, I agree with the author that size of neighborhood affects the impression. A way to improve that owuld be normalizing the values first, and using per square meter values.
