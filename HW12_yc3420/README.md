# This is the working space for Yunhe Cui, HW12.

## I collaborated with Mingyi He (mh5172) in both of the assignments. I did the data download and hierarchical clustering parts for both assignments and Mingyi did the rest parts.  

## Assignment 1: 
Cluster zipcodes based on the economic development (business counts) 
in time for 1993-2006 Clustering often takes time, particularly hierarchical clustering.

## Assignment 2:
The second part of time series exercise. Recieved some help from Nathan (nbc270) on the plotting part.
